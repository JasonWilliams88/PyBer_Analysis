## Analysis
Upon analysis of the data we can conclude the following
- Rides per city type

As you would assume, and urban setting accounted for 68% of the total usage followed by 26% in the Suburbs

- Total drivers per city type

from the analysis we can see that Urban drivers are over represented. there were more drivers than total rides.

- total fares per city type

As expected Urban had the highest total fare followed by Suburban and finally Rural.

- average fare per city type

It seems as Density increases less is made per ride

- average fare per driver for each city type

The differences here seem the most drastic. It would fares per driver increase 70% in a Rural setting as opposed to a Urban one
