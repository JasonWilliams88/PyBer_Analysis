## Analysis
__Upon analysis of the data we can conclude the following__

- Rides per city type

As you would assume, and urban setting accounted for 68% of the total usage followed by 26% in the Suburbs.

- Total drivers per city type

from the analysis we can see that Urban drivers are over represented. there were more drivers than total rides.

- total fares per city type

As expected Urban had the highest total fare followed by Suburban and finally Rural.

- average fare per city type

It seems as density increases, less is made per ride.

- average fare per driver for each city type

The differences here seem the most drastic. It would seem fares per driver increase 70% in a Rural setting as opposed to an Urban one.

- 4 month snapshot of overall fares per city type

When we track total fares over time we get a very stagnant picture. Little growth seems to be occuring in this 4 month snapshot. 


## Discussion

### Recommendations
- The first order of business would be to increase the average price per driver. We can assume the difference stems from either inactive drivers bringing the average down and/or the average distance driven is shorter combined with the significantly higher amount of drivers compared to the rides given. By implementing a surge price during certain times or areas we can increase the revenue for the drivers.
- The lack of growth needs to be addressed also. An increase in marketing would help ridership greatly. You can point to the increase in driver pay as a reason to pick PyBer over your competitors.
- The Suburban and Rural city types seems to be neglected the most when compared to the amount of money it brings in. Give drivers an incentive to venture farther out from the city limits to cover under capitalized areas.
