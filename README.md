## Analysis
Upon analysis of the data we can conclude the following
- Rides per city type

As you would assume, and urban setting accounted for 68% of the total usage followed by 26% in the Suburbs

- Total drivers per city type

from the analysis we can see that Urban drivers are over represented. there were more drivers than total rides.

- total fares per city type
- average fare per city type
- average fare per driver for each city type
- 4 month snapshot of overall fares per city type
